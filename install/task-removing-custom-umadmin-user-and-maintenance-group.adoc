If you created a custom home directory to define your own umadmin user and maintenance account prior to installing Unified Manager, you should remove these items after you have uninstalled Unified Manager.

== About this task

The standard Unified Manager uninstallation does not remove a custom-defined umadmin user and maintenance account. You must delete these items manually.

== Steps

. Log in as the root user to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux server.
. Delete the umadmin user:``userdel umadmin``
. Delete the maintenance group:``groupdel maintenance``
