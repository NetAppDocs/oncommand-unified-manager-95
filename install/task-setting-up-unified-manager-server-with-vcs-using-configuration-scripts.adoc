[.lead]
You can configure Unified Manager with Veritas Cluster Server (VCS) using configuration scripts.

== Before you begin

* Unified Manager must be installed on both the nodes in the VCS setup.
* The XML:: LibXML module must be bundled with Perl for VCS scripts to work.
* You must have created a shared LUN with sufficient size to accommodate the source Unified Manager data.
* You must have specified the absolute mount path for the script to work.
+
The script will not work if you create a folder inside the mount path.

* You must have downloaded the `ha_setup.pl` script at `/opt/netapp/ocum/scripts`.

== About this task

In the VCS setup, the node for which the virtual IP interface and mount point are active is the first node. The other node is the second node.

== Steps

. Log in to the first node of the cluster.
+
You must have stopped all the Unified Manager services on the second node in the high availability setup.

. Add the VCS installation directory `/opt/VRTSvcs/bin` to the PATH environmental variable.
. If you are configuring an existing Unified Manager setup, create a Unified Manager backup and generate the support bundle.
. Run the `ha_setup.pl` script: `perl ha_setup.pl --first -t vcs -g group_name -e eth_name -i cluster_ip -m net_mask -n fully_qualified_cluster_name -f mount_path -v volume_group -d disk_group -l install_dir -u user_name -p password`
+
`perl \ha_setup.pl --first -t vcs -g umgroup -e eth0 -i 10.11.12.13 -m 255.255.255.0 -n cluster.eng.company.com -f /mnt/ocumdb -v ocumdb_SdHv -d ocumdb_SdDg -l /opt/netapp/ -u admin -p wx17yz`

. Use the Veritas Operation Manager web console or VCS Cluster Manager to verify that a failover group is created, and that the Unified Manager server services, mount point, virtual IP, network interface card (NIC), and volume group are added to the cluster group.
. Manually move the Unified Manager service group to the secondary node and verify that cluster failover is working.
. Verify that VCS has switched over to the second node of the cluster.
+
You must verify that the data mount, virtual IP, volume group, and NIC are online on the second node of the cluster.

. Stop Unified Manager using Veritas Operation Manager.
. Run the `perl ha_setup.pl --join -t vcs -f``mount_path` command on the second node of the cluster so that the Unified Manager server data points to the LUN.
. Verify that the Unified Manager server services are starting properly on the second node of the cluster.
. Regenerate the Unified Manager certificate after running the configuration scripts to obtain the global IP address.
 .. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *HTTPS Certificate* from the *Setup* menu.
 .. Click *Regenerate HTTPS Certificate*.

+
The regenerated certificate provides only the cluster IP address, not the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You must use the global IP address to set up Unified Manager for high-availability.
. Access the Unified Manager UI using the following link: `\https://<FQDN of Global IP>`

== After you finish

You must create a shared backup location after high availability is configured. The shared location is required for containing the backups that you create before and after failover. Both the nodes in the high-availability setup must be able to access the shared location.
