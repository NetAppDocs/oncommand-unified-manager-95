[.lead]
After installing Unified Manager on both cluster nodes, you can configure Unified Manager with Failover Cluster Manager using configuration scripts.

== Before you begin

You must have created a shared LUN that is of a sufficient size to accommodate the source Unified Manager data.

== Steps

. Log in to the first node of the cluster.
. Create a role in Windows 2012 or Windows 2016 using Failover Cluster Manager:
 .. Launch Failover Cluster Manager.
 .. Create the empty role by clicking *Roles* > *Create Empty Role*.
 .. Add the global IP address to the role by right-clicking *Role* > *Add Resources* > *More Resources* > *IP address*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Both nodes must be able to ping this IP address because Unified Manager is launched using this IP address after high availability is configured.
====

 .. Add the data disk to the role by right-clicking *Role* > *Add Storage*.
. Run the `ha_setup.pl` script on the first node: `perl ha_setup.pl --first -t mscs -g group_name -i ip address -n fully_qualified_domain_cluster_name -f shared_location_path -k data_disk -u user_name -p password`
+
`C:\Program Files\NetApp\ocum\bin>perl .\ha_setup.pl --first -t mscs -g umgroup -i "IP Address" -n spr38457002.eng.company.com -k "Cluster Disk 2" -f E:\ -u admin -p wx17yz`
+
The script is available at `Install_Dir\NetApp\ocum\bin`.

 ** You can obtain the value of the `-g`, `-k`, and `-i` options using the `cluster res` command.
 ** The `-n` option must be the FQDN of the global IP address that can be pinged from both nodes.

. Verify that the Unified Manager server services, data disk, and cluster IP address are added to the cluster group by using the Failover Cluster Manager web console.
. Stop all Unified Manager server services (MySQL, ocie, and ocieau) by using the `services.msc` command.
. Switch the service group to the second node in Failover Cluster Manager.
. Run the command `perl ha_setup.pl --join -t mscs -f``shared_location_path` on the second node of the cluster to point to the Unified Manager server data to the LUN.
+
`perl ha_setup.pl --join -t mscs -f E:\`

. Bring all the Unified Manager services online using Failover Cluster Manager.
. Manually switch to the other node of the Microsoft Cluster Server.
. Verify that the Unified Manager server services are starting properly on the other node of the cluster.
. Regenerate the Unified Manager certificate after running configuration scripts to obtain the global IP address.
 .. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *HTTPS Certificate* from the *Setup* menu.
 .. Click *Regenerate HTTPS Certificate*.

+
The regenerated certificate provides the cluster IP address, not the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You must use the global IP address to set up Unified Manager for high-availability.
. Access the Unified Manager UI using the following link: `https://<FQDN of Global IP>`

== After you finish

You must create a shared backup location after high availability is configured. The shared location is required for containing the backups before and after failover. Both nodes in the high-availability setup must be able to access the shared location.
