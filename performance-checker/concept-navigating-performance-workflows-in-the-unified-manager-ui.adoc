The Unified Manager interface provides many pages for the collection and display of performance information. You use the left navigation panel to navigate to pages in the GUI, and you use tabs and links on the pages to view and configure information.

You use all of the following pages to monitor and troubleshoot cluster performance information:

* dashboard pages
* storage object inventory pages
* storage object landing pages (including the performance explorer)
* configuration and setup pages
* events pages

[NOTE]
====
A page in Unified Manager might display a large amount of information. To see all of the available information, always scroll to the bottom of the page.
