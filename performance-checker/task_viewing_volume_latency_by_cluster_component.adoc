You can view detailed latency information for a volume by using the Performance/Volume Explorer page. The Latency - Total counter chart shows total latency on the volume, and the Latency - Breakdown counter chart is useful for determining the impact of read and write latency on the volume.

== About this task

Additionally, the Latency - Cluster Components chart shows a detailed comparison of the latency of each cluster component to help determine how each component contributes to the total latency on the volume. The following cluster components are displayed:

* Network
* QoS Policy
* Network Processing
* Cluster Interconnect
* Data Processing
* Aggregate Operations
* MetroCluster Resources
* Cloud Latency
* Sync SnapMirror

== Steps

. In the *Performance/Volume Explorer* page for your selected volume, from the Latency chart, select *Cluster Components* from the drop-down menu.
+
The Latency - Cluster Components chart is displayed.

. To view a larger version of the chart, select *Zoom View*.
+
The cluster component comparative chart is displayed. You can restrict the comparison by deselecting or selecting the image:../media/eye_icon.gif[] that is associated with each cluster component.

. To view the specific values, move your cursor into the chart area to see the popup window.
