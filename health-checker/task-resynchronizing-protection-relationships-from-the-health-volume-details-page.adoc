You can resynchronize data on a SnapMirror or SnapVault relationship that was broken and then the destination was made read/write so that data on the source matches the data on the destination. You might also resynchronize when a required common Snapshot copy on the source volume is deleted causing SnapMirror or SnapVault updates to fail.

== Before you begin

* You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have set up OnCommand Workflow Automation.

== Steps

. From the *Protection* tab of the *Health/Volume* details page, locate in the topology the protection relationship that you want to resynchronize and right-click it.
. Select *Resynchronize* from the menu.
+
Alternatively, from the *Actions* menu, select *Relationship* > *Resynchronize* to resynchronize the relationship for which you are currently viewing the details.
+
The Resynchronize dialog box is displayed.

. In the *Resynchronization Options* tab, select a transfer priority and the maximum transfer rate.
. Click *Source Snapshot Copies*; then, in the *Snapshot Copy* column, click *Default*.
+
The Select Source Snapshot Copy dialog box is displayed.

. If you want to specify an existing Snapshot copy rather than transferring the default Snapshot copy, click *Existing Snapshot Copy* and select a Snapshot copy from the list.
. Click *Submit*.
+
You are returned to the Resynchronize dialog box.

. If you selected more than one source to resynchronize, click *Default* for the next source for which you want to specify an existing Snapshot copy.
. Click *Submit* to begin the resynchronization job.
+
The resynchronization job is started, you are returned to the Health/Volume details page and a jobs link is displayed at the top of the page.

. Click *View Jobs* on the *Health/Volume* details page to track the status of each resynchronization job.
+
A filtered list of jobs is displayed.

. Click the Back arrow on your browser to return to the *Health/Volume* details page.
+
The resynchronization job is finished when all job tasks successfully complete.
