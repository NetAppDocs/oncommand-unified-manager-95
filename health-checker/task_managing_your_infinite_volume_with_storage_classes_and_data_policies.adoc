[.lead]
You can effectively manage your Infinite Volume by creating the Infinite Volume with the required number of storage classes, configuring thresholds for each storage class, creating rules and a data policy to determine the placement of data written to the Infinite Volume, configuring data protection, and optionally configuring notification alerts.

== Before you begin

* OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) must be installed.
* You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have created the required number of aggregates by customizing the appropriate predefined workflow in WFA.
* You must have created the required number of storage classes by customizing the appropriate predefined workflow in WFA.
* You must have configured the Unified Manager server as a data source in WFA, and then you must have verified that the data is cached successfully.

== About this task

While performing this task, you are required to switch between two applications: OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) and OnCommand Unified Manager.

The task provides high-level steps. For details about performing the WFA tasks, see the _OnCommand Workflow Automation_ documentation.

== Steps

. image:../media/wfa_icon.gif[Icon for WFA procedure] Customize the predefined workflow to define the required storage classes.
. image:../media/wfa_icon.gif[Icon for WFA procedure] Create an SVM with Infinite Volume with the required number of storage classes by using the appropriate workflow.
. image:../media/um_icon.gif[Icon for Unified Manager procedure] Add the cluster containing the SVM with Infinite Volume to the Unified Manager database.
+
You can add the cluster by providing the IP address or the FQDN of the cluster.

+
You should use the default storage class threshold settings to effectively monitor storage class space.

. image:../media/um_icon.gif[Icon for Unified Manager procedure] xref:task_creating_rules.adoc[Set up rules in the data policy, and then activate all the changes made to the data policy]
+
Rules in a data policy determine the placement of the content written to the Infinite Volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
Rules in a data policy affect only new data written to the Infinite Volume and do not affect existing data in the Infinite Volume.

 .. Create a data protection (DP) Infinite Volume by using the appropriate workflow.
 .. Set up a DP mirror relationship between the source and destination by using the appropriate workflow.
