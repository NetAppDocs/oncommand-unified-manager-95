While Unified Manager provides reporting functionality, you might need to create new reports that are specific to your environment. You can create new reports using the Eclipse Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT), and then import them into Unified Manager to view and manage.

== Before you begin

You must have the OnCommand Administrator role.

You must have downloaded and installed MySQL Connector/J. You must have the location of the mysql-connector-java-5.1.32-bin.jar file to create the JBDC data source, which connects the report to Unified Manager.

== About this task

For more detailed information on creating reports, see the Eclipse BIRT website.
