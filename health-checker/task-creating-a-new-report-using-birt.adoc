You can create a new report using the Eclipse plug-in for Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT). You might want to create new reports if the existing reports in Unified Manager do not meet the needs of your environment.

== Before you begin

You must have downloaded and extracted BIRT.

You must have created a project using BIRT.

== Steps

. From the BIRT interface, select *File* > *New* > *Report*.
. In the *New Report* dialog box and select the project folder, which should be the same as the project folder previously created.
+
If you select a different project folder, you cannot use the reporting operations in Unified Manager.

. Type the report file name, and click *Next*.
. Select the report type and click *Finish*.
