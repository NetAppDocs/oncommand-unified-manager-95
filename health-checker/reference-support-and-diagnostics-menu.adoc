The Support and Diagnostics menu enables you to generate a support bundle.

The following menu option is available:

Enables you to create a 7-Zip file containing full diagnostic information in the diagnostic user's home directory. The file includes information generated by an AutoSupport message, the contents of the Unified Manager database, detailed data about the Unified Manager server internals, and verbose-level logs not normally included in AutoSupport messages.
