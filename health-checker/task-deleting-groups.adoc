You can delete a group from Unified Manager when the group is no longer required.

== Before you begin

* None of the storage objects (clusters, SVMs, or volumes) must be associated with any group rule that is associated with the group that you want to delete.
* You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Management* > *Groups*.
. In the *Groups* tab, select the group that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. In the *Warning* dialog box , confirm the deletion by clicking *Yes*.
+
Deleting a group does not delete the group actions that are associated with the group. However, these group actions will be unmapped after the group is deleted.
