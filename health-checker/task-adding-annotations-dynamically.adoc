When you create custom annotations, Unified Manager dynamically associates clusters, storage virtual machines (SVMs), and volumes with the annotations by using rules. These rules automatically assign the annotations to storage objects.

== Before you begin

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Annotations* in the left Management menu.
. In the *Annotations* page, click *Add Annotation*.
. In the *Add Annotation* dialog box, type a name and description for the annotation.
+
You can also add values to annotations while creating annotations.

. Optional: In the *Annotation Values* section, click *Add* to add values to the annotation.
. Click *Save and Close*.
