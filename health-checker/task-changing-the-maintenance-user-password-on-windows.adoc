You can change the Unified Manager maintenance user password when required.

== Steps

. From the Unified Manager web UI login page, click *Forgot Password*.
+
A page is displayed that prompts for the name of the user whose password you want to reset.

. Enter the user name and click *Submit*.
+
An email with a link to reset the password is sent to the email address that is defined for that user name.

. Click the *reset password link* in the email and define the new password.
. Return to the web UI and log in to Unified Manager using the new password.

== After you finish

If Unified Manager is installed in a Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) environment, then you must change the maintenance user password on the second node of the MSCS setup. The maintenance user password for both nodes must be same.
