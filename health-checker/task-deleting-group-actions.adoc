You can delete a group action from Unified Manager when the group action is no longer required.

== Before you begin

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== About this task

When you delete the group action for the volume health threshold, global thresholds are applied to the storage objects in that group. Any object-level health thresholds that are set on the storage object are not impacted.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Management* > *Groups*.
. In the *Group Actions* tab, select the group action that you want to delete, and then click *Delete*.
. In the *Warning* dialog box, confirm the deletion by clicking *Yes*.
