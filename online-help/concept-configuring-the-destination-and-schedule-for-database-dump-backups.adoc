[.lead]
You can configure the Unified Manager database backup settings to set the database backup path, retention count, and backup schedules. You can enable daily or weekly scheduled backups. By default, scheduled backups are disabled.

== Before you begin

* You must have the Operator, OnCommand Administrator, or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have a minimum of 150 GB of space available in the location you define as the backup path.
+
It is recommended that you use a remote location that is external to the Unified Manager host system.

* When Unified Manager is installed on a Linux system, verify that the "`jboss`" user has write permissions to the backup directory.
* You should not schedule backup operations to occur immediately after a new cluster has been added while Unified Manager is collecting 15 days of historical performance data.

== About this task

More time is required the first time a backup is performed than for subsequent backups because the first backup is a full backup. A full backup can be over 1 GB and can take three to four hours. Subsequent backups are incremental and require less time.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Management* > *Database Backup*.
. In the *Management/Database Backup* page, click *Actions* > *Database Backup Settings*.
. Configure the appropriate values for a backup path and retention count.
+
The default value for retention count is 10; you can use 0 for creating unlimited backups.

. In the *Schedule Frequency* section, select the *Enable* checkbox, and then specify a daily or weekly schedule.
 ** *Daily*
+
If you select this option, you must enter a time in 24-hour format for creating the backup. For example, if you specify 18:30, then a backup is created daily at 6:30 PM.

 ** *Weekly*
+
If you select this option, you must specify the time and day for creating the backup. For example, if you specify the day as Monday and time as 16:30, then a weekly backup is created every Monday at 4:30 PM.
. Click *Save and Close*.
