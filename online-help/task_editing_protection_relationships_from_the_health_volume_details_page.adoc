You can edit existing protection relationships to change the current maximum transfer rate, protection policy, or protection schedule. You might edit a relationship to decrease the bandwidth used for transfers, or to increase the frequency of scheduled transfers because data is changing often.

== Before you begin

* You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have installed and configured Workflow Automation.

== About this task

The selected volumes must be protection relationship destinations. You cannot edit relationships when source volumes, load-sharing volumes, or volumes that are not the destination of a SnapMirror or SnapVault relationship are selected.

== Steps

. From the *Protection* tab of the *Health/Volume* details page, locate in the topology the protection relationship you want to edit and right-click it.
. Select *Edit* from the menu.
+
Alternatively, from the *Actions* menu, select *Relationship* > *Edit* to edit the relationship for which you are currently viewing the details.
+
The Edit Relationship dialog box is displayed.

. In the *Edit Relationship* dialog box, edit the maximum transfer rate, protection policy, or protection schedule, as needed.
. Click *Apply*.
+
The changes are applied to the selected relationships.
