All three fields are required for each filter; the available filters reflect the filterable columns on the current page. The maximum number of filters you can apply is four. Filtered results are based on combined filter parameters. Filtered results apply to all pages in your filtered search, not just the page currently displayed.

You can add filters using the Filtering panel.

. At the top of the page, click *Filtering*. TheFiltering panel displays.
. In the Filtering panel, click the left drop-down list, and select an object name: for example, _Cluster_, or a performance counter.
. Click the center drop-down list, and select the boolean operator *name contains* or *name starts with* if the first selection was an object name. If the first selection was a performance counter, select *greater than* or *less than*. If the first selection was *Status*, select *is* or *is not*.
. If your search criteria requires a numeric value, up and down arrow buttons display in the field at the right. You can click the up and down arrow buttons to display your desired numeric value.
. If required, type your non-numeric search criteria in the text field at the right.
. To add filters, click *Add Filter*. An additional filter field displays. Complete this filter using the process described in the preceding steps. Note that upon adding your fourth filter, the *Add Filter* button no longer displays.
. Click *Apply Filter*. The filter options are applied to the grid and an asterisk (*) is displayed in the Filtering button.
. Use the Filtering panel to remove individual filters by clicking the trash icon at the right of the filter to be removed.
. To remove all filters, click *Reset* at the bottom of the filtering panel.
