The Performance/Aggregates inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each aggregate that is monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This page enables you to monitor the performance of your aggregates, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to this page, a different title may be displayed on the page to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all aggregates, the title is "`Aggregates`". When displaying a subset of aggregates that are returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`Aggregates on which policy aggr_IOPS is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

Root aggregates are not displayed on this page.

== Aggregates inventory page columns

The Performance/Aggregates inventory page contains the following columns for each aggregate.

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Aggregate*
+
You can click the aggregate name to navigate to that aggregate's performance details page.

* *Aggregate Type*
+
The type of aggregate:

 ** HDD
 ** Hybrid
+
Combines HDDs and SSDs, but Flash Pool has not been enabled.

 ** Hybrid (Flash Pool)
+
Combines HDDs and SSDs, and Flash Pool has been enabled.

 ** SSD
 ** SSD (FabricPool)
+
Combines SSDs and a cloud tier

 ** VMDisk (SDS)
+
Virtual disks within a virtual machine

 ** VMDisk (FabricPool)
+
Combines virtual disks and a cloud tier

 ** LUN (FlexArray)
This column displays "`Not Available`" when the monitored storage system is running a version of ONTAP earlier than 8.3.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests on the aggregate, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second on the aggregate.

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the aggregate, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Performance Capacity Used*
+
The percentage of performance capacity that is being used by the aggregate.
+
[NOTE]
====
Performance capacity data is available only when the nodes in a cluster are installed with ONTAP 9.0 or later software.
====

* *Utilization*
+
The percentage of the aggregate's disks that are currently being used.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity for this aggregate, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity for this aggregate, in gigabytes.

* *Inactive Data Reporting*
+
Whether the inactive data reporting capability is enabled or disabled on this aggregate. When enabled, volumes on this aggregate display the amount of cold data in the Performance/Volumes inventory page.
+
The value in this field is "`N/A`" when the version of ONTAP does not support inactive data reporting.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the aggregate belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Node*
+
The node to which the aggregate belongs. You can click the node name to navigate to that node's details page.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
