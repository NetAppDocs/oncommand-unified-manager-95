= Certain special characters do not work with reporting search
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

* *Issue*
+
Using the special characters % and _ while searching within a report causes the operation to fail.

* *Corrective action*
+
If you search for a string that contains % or _, you should use a double backslash before the specified character.
+
For example, to find a string containing S_10, you should enter S\\_10.
