You can use the Create Resource Pool dialog box to group aggregates for provisioning purposes.

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== About this task

Resource pools can contain aggregates from different clusters, but the same aggregate cannot belong to different resource pools.

== Steps

. In the left navigation pane, click *Protection* > *Resource Pools*.
. In the *Protection/Resource Pools* page, click *Create*.
. Follow the instructions in the *Create Resource Pool* dialog box to provide a name and description and to add aggregates as members to the resource pool you want to create.
