An Infinite Volume is a single, scalable volume that can store up to 2 billion files and tens of petabytes of data.

With an Infinite Volume, you can manage multiple petabytes of data in one large logical entity and clients can retrieve multiple petabytes of data from a single junction path for the entire volume.

An Infinite Volume uses storage from multiple aggregates on multiple nodes. You can start with a small Infinite Volume and expand it nondisruptively by adding more disks to its aggregates or by providing it with more aggregates to use.
