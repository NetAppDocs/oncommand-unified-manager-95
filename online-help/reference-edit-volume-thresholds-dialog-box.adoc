You can configure alerts to send notifications when an event related to a volume's capacity is generated, and you can take corrective actions for the event. For example, for the Volume Full threshold, you can configure an alert to send notification when the condition persists over a specified period.

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

The Edit Volume Thresholds dialog box enables you to configure volume-level thresholds that are applied to the selected volumes. When thresholds are configured at the volume level, they take priority over the group-level thresholds or the global-level threshold values.

You can configure threshold settings for capacity, Snapshot copies, qtree quota, growth, and inodes at the volume level. When a group action of volume threshold type is configured, the group action threshold values are used for settings that are not configured at the volume level. When no group action of volume threshold type is configured, areas in Edit Volume Thresholds dialog box that are not configured, use global threshold values.

== Capacity area

The Capacity area enables you to set the following volume capacity threshold conditions:

* *Space Nearly Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume is considered to be nearly full. It also displays the size of the volume corresponding to the specified threshold value.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

* *Space Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume is considered full. It also displays the size of the volume corresponding to the specified threshold value.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

* *Days Until Full*
+
Specifies the number of days remaining before the volume reaches full capacity.

== Snapshot Copies

The Snapshot Copies area enables you to set the following threshold conditions for the Snapshot copies in the volume.

* *Snapshot Reserve Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which the space reserved for Snapshot copies is considered full.

* *Days Until Full*
+
Specifies the number of days remaining before the space reserved for Snapshot copies reaches full capacity.

* *Count*
+
Specifies the number of Snapshot copies on a volume that are considered to be too many.

== Qtree Quota area

The Qtree Quota area enables you to set the following qtree quota threshold conditions for the selected volumes:

* *Nearly Overcommitted*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume is considered to be nearly overcommitted by qtree quotas.

* *Overcommitted*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume is considered to be overcommitted by qtree quotas.

== Growth area

The Growth area enables you to set the following threshold condition for volume growth:

* *Growth Rate*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume's growth rate is considered to be normal before the system generates a Volume Growth Rate Abnormal event.

* *Growth Rate Sensitivity*
+
Specifies the factor that is applied to the standard deviation of a volume's growth rate. If the growth rate exceeds the factored standard deviation, a Volume Growth Rate Abnormal event is generated.
+
A lower value for growth rate sensitivity indicates that the volume is highly sensitive to changes in the growth rate.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you modify the growth rate sensitivity for volumes at the global threshold level, the change is also applied to the growth rate sensitivity for aggregates at the global threshold level.
====

== Inodes area

The Inodes area enables you to set the following threshold conditions for inodes:

* *Nearly Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume is considered to have consumed most of its inodes.
+
You can also use the sliders to set the threshold value.

* *Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a volume is considered to have consumed all of its inodes.
+
You can also use the sliders to set the threshold value.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following tasks for a selected volume:

* *Restore to Defaults*
+
Enables you to restore the threshold values to one of the following:

 ** Group values, if the volume belongs to a group and that group has a volume threshold action type.
 ** Global values, if the volume does not belong to any group or if it belongs to a group that does not have a volume threshold action type.

* *Save*
+
Saves all the threshold settings.

* *Save and Close*
+
Saves all the threshold settings and then closes the dialog box.

* *Cancel*
+
Ignores the changes (if any) to the threshold settings and closes the dialog box.
