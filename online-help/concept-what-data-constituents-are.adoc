In an Infinite Volume, data is stored in multiple separate data constituents. Data constituents store only the data from a file, not the file's name.

Clients are not aware of data constituents. When a client requests a file from an Infinite Volume, the node retrieves the file's data from a data constituent and returns the file to the client.

Each Infinite Volume typically has dozens of data constituents. For example, a 6 PB Infinite Volume that contains 1 billion files might have 60 data constituents located on aggregates from 6 nodes.
