You can change your local user login password to prevent potential security risks.

== Before you begin

You must be logged in as a local user.

== About this task

The passwords for the maintenance user and for remote users cannot be changed using these steps. To change a remote user password, contact your password administrator. To change the maintenance user password, see link:../health-checker/task-using-the-maintenance-console.html[Using the Maintenance Console].

== Steps

. Log in to Unified Manager.
. From the top menu bar, click the user icon and then click *Change Password*.
+
The *Change Password* option is not displayed if you are a remote user.

. In the *Change Password* dialog box, enter the current password and the new password.
. Click *Save*.

== After you finish

If Unified Manager is configured in a high-availability configuration, you must change the password on the second node of the setup. Both instances must have same password.
