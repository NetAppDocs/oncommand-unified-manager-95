You can add an existing cluster so that you can monitor the cluster and obtain information about its health, capacity, configuration, and performance.

You can add a cluster by specifying the following values:

* *Host Name or IP Address*
+
Enables you to specify the host name (preferred) or the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the cluster-management LIF that is used to connect to the cluster. By specifying the host name, you will be able to match the name of the cluster across the web UI, rather than trying to correlate an IP address on one page to a host name on another page.

* *User Name*
+
Enables you to specify a user name that can be used to log in to the cluster.

* *Password*
+
Enables you to specify a password for the specified user name.

* *Protocol*
+
Enables you to specify the type of protocol that can be configured on the cluster. You can enable HTTP or HTTPS (for a secure connection). Connection is established with the cluster by using both protocols and HTTPS is chosen over HTTP. By default, HTTPS is enabled with the default port 443.

* *Port*
+
Enables you to specify the port number used to connect to the cluster. If the port is not specified, the default port for the selected protocol is used (80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).
