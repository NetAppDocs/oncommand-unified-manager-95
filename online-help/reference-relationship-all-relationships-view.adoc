The Protection/Volume Relationships page displays information about protection relationships on the storage system.

Use the *Export* button to export the details of all the relationships to a comma-separated values (`.csv`) file.

* *Relationship Status*
+
Displays the current status of the protection relationship.
+
The status can be one of Error (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[]), Warning (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[]), or Normal (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[]).

* *Lag Status*
+
Displays the lag status for managed relationships, and for unmanaged relationships that have a schedule associated with that relationship. Lag status can be:

 ** Error (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[])
+
The lag duration is greater than or equal to the lag error threshold.

 ** Warning (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[])
+
The lag duration is greater than or equal to the lag warning threshold.

 ** Normal (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[])
+
The lag duration is within normal limits.

 ** Not Applicable
+
The lag status is not applicable for synchronous relationships because a schedule cannot be configured.

* *Transfer Status*
+
Displays the transfer status for the protection relationship. The transfer status can be one of the following:

 ** Aborting
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled; however, a transfer abort operation that might include removal of the checkpoint is in progress.

 ** Checking
+
The destination volume is undergoing a diagnostic check and no transfer is in progress.

 ** Finalizing
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled. The volume is currently in the post-transfer phase for incremental SnapVault transfers.

 ** Idle
+
Transfers are enabled and no transfer is in progress.

 ** In-Sync
+
The data in the two volumes in the synchronous relationship are synchronized.

 ** Out-of-Sync
+
The data in the destination volume is not synchronized with the source volume.

 ** Preparing
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled. The volume is currently in the pre-transfer phase for incremental SnapVault transfers.

 ** Queued
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled. No transfers are in progress.

 ** Quiesced
+
SnapMirror transfers are disabled. No transfer is in progress.

 ** Quiescing
+
A SnapMirror transfer is in progress. Additional transfers are disabled.

 ** Transferring
+
SnapMirror transfers are enabled and a transfer is in progress.

 ** Transitioning
+
The asynchronous transfer of data from the source to the destination volume is complete, and the transition to synchronous operation has started.

 ** Waiting
+
A SnapMirror transfer has been initiated, but some associated tasks are waiting to be queued.

* *Relationship Type*
+
Displays the relationship type used to replicate a volume. Relationship types include:

 ** Asynchronous Mirror
 ** Asynchronous Vault
 ** StrictSync
 ** Sync

* *Source SVM*
+
Displays the name of the source SVM.
+
If the message `Resource-key not discovered` is displayed, this might indicate that the SVM exists on the cluster but has not yet been added to the Unified Manager inventory, or that the SVM was created after the cluster's last refresh. You must ensure that the SVM exists, or perform a rediscovery on the cluster to refresh the list of resources.
+
You can move your pointer over the source SVM to view information such as the cluster, volume type, protocols allowed, and spaced used. You can view more details about the SVM by clicking on the SVM name.

* *Source Volume*
+
Displays the source volume being protected. You can view more details about the source volume by clicking the source volume name.
+
If the message `Resource-key not discovered` is displayed, this might indicate that the volume exists on the cluster but has not yet been added to the Unified Manager inventory, or that the volume was created after the cluster's last refresh. You must ensure that the volume exists, or perform a rediscovery on the cluster to refresh the list of resources.

* *Destination SVM*
+
Displays the name of the destination SVM.
+
You can move your pointer over the destination SVM to view information such as the cluster, volume type, protocols allowed, and space used. You can view more details about the SVM by clicking on the SVM name.

* *Destination Volume*
+
Displays the name of the destination volume.
+
You can move the pointer over a volume to view information such as the aggregate containing the volume, qtree quota overcommitted space, status of the last volume move operation, and space allocated in the volume. You can also view the details of related objects such as the SVM to which the volume belongs, the aggregate to which the volume belongs, and all the volumes that belong to this aggregate.

* *Lag Duration*
+
Displays the amount of time that the data on the mirror lags behind the source.
+
The lag duration should be close to, or equal to, 0 seconds for StrictSync relationships.

* *Last Successful Update*
+
Displays the time of the last successful SnapMirror or SnapVault operation.
+
The last successful update is not applicable for synchronous relationships.

* *Last Transfer Duration*
+
Displays the time taken for the last data transfer to complete.
+
The transfer duration is not applicable for StrictSync relationships because the transfer should be simultaneous.

* *Last Transfer Size*
+
Displays the size, in bytes, of the last data transfer.
+
The transfer size is not applicable for StrictSync relationships.

* *Relationship Health*
+
Displays the relationship heath of the cluster.

* *Relationship State*
+
Displays the the mirror state of the SnapMirror relationship.

* *Unhealthy Reason*
+
The reason the relationship is in an unhealthy state.

* *Source Cluster*
+
Displays the name of the source cluster for the SnapMirror relationship.

* *Source Node*
+
Displays the name of the source node for the SnapMirror relationship.

* *Destination Cluster*
+
Displays the name of the destination cluster for the SnapMirror relationship.

* *Destination Node*
+
Displays the name of the destination node for the SnapMirror relationship.

* *Transfer Priority*
+
Displays the priority at which a transfer runs. The transfer priority is Normal or Low. Normal priority transfers are scheduled before low priority transfers.
+
The transfer priority is not applicable for synchronous relationships because all transfers are treated with the same priority.

* *Policy*
+
Displays the protection policy for the volume. You can click the policy name to view details associated with that policy, including the following information:

 ** Transfer priority
+
Specifies the priority at which a transfer runs for asynchronous operations. The transfer priority is Normal or Low. Normal priority transfers are scheduled before low priority transfers. The default is Normal.

 ** Ignore access time
+
Applies only to SnapVault relationships. This specifies whether incremental transfers ignore files which have only their access time changed. The values are either True or False. The default is False.

 ** When Relationship is Out of Sync
+
Specifies the action ONTAP performs when a synchronous relationship is not able to be synchronized. StrictSync relationships will restrict access to the primary volume if there is a failure to synchronize with the secondary volume. Sync relationships do not restrict access to the primary if there is a failure to synchronize with the secondary.

 ** Tries limit
+
Specifies the maximum number of times to attempt each manual or scheduled transfer for a SnapMirror relationship. The default is 8.

 ** Comments
+
Provides a text field for comments for specific to the selected policy.

 ** SnapMirror label
+
Specifies the SnapMirror label for the first schedule associated with the Snapshot copy policy. The SnapMirror label is used by the SnapVault subsystem when you back up Snapshot copies to a SnapVault destination.

 ** Retention settings
+
Specifies how long backups are kept, based on the time or the number of backups.

 ** Actual Snapshot copies
+
Specifies the number of Snapshot copies on this volume that match the specified label.

 ** Preserve Snapshot copies
+
Specifies the number of SnapVault Snapshot copies that are not deleted automatically even if the maximum limit for the policy is reached. The values are either True or False. The default is False.

 ** Retention warning threshold
+
Specifies the Snapshot copy limit at which a warning is sent to indicate that the maximum retention limit is nearly reached.

* *Schedule*
+
Displays the name of the protection schedule assigned to the relationship. You can click the schedule name to view details about the schedule.
+
The schedule is not applicable for synchronous relationships.

* *Version Flexible Replication*
+
Displays either Yes, Yes with backup option, or None.
