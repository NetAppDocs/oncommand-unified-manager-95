The Unified ManagerCluster View overview dashboard provides high-level information about the health of the clusters you are managing. The Cluster View dashboard consists of two major sections: Managed Clusters (on the left) and Cluster Details (on the right).

The following image shows an example of a Unified ManagerCluster View dashboard that is monitoring eight clusters:

The status icon next to each cluster name can be in the following states:

* Critical (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]): One or more active critical events have been reported for the cluster.
* Error (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]): One or more active error events have been reported for the cluster.
* Warning (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]): One or more active warning events have been reported for the cluster.
* Normal (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]): No active events have been reported for the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The color indicates whether active (new or acknowledged) events exist for the object. Events that are no longer active, called obsolete events, do not affect the color of the icon.

To display additional information about a cluster, you can perform one of the following actions:

* You can click a cluster name to display overview information on the monitoring status, capacity status, and performance status of the cluster.
* You can click *Manage Clusters* to display the Configuration/Cluster Data Sources page, where you can view detailed status information for all the clusters being managed by this instance of Unified Manager.
