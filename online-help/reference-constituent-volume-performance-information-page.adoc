Use the Performance/Constituent Volume Information page to view a list of the physical and logical attributes of the FlexGroup constituent volume. This information might help in answering performance-related questions.

== Constituent Volume attributes

* *Type*
+
The constituent's type; either read-write (RW) or data-protection (DP).

* *Style*
+
The style of volume; this is a constituent volume of a FlexGroup volume.

* *Cluster*
+
The name of the cluster to which this FlexGroup constituent volume belongs. You can click the name to display cluster details in the Performance/Cluster Explorer page.

* *Aggregate*
+
The name of the aggregate on which this FlexGroup constituent volume resides. You can click the name to display aggregate details in the Performance/Aggregate Explorer page.

* *FlexGroup*
+
The name of the FlexGroup volume to which this constituent belongs. You can click the name to display FlexGroup volume details in the Performance/FlexGroup Explorer page.

* *Storage Virtual Machine*
+
The name of the SVM to which this FlexGroup constituent volume belongs. You can click the name to display SVM details in the Performance/SVM Explorer page.

* *Tiering Policy*
+
The tiering policy set on the volume. The policy takes affect only when the volume is deployed on a FabricPool aggregate. The available policies are:

 ** None. The data for this volume always remains on the performance tier.
 ** Snapshot Only. Only Snapshot data is moved automatically to the cloud tier. All other data remains on the performance tier.
 ** Backup. On data protection volumes, all transferred user data starts in the cloud tier, but later client reads can cause hot data to move to the performance tier.
 ** Auto. Data on this volume is moved between the performance tier and the cloud tier automatically when ONTAP determines that the data is "`hot`" or "`cold`".

* *RAID Type*
+
The redundancy type that is being used on the aggregate where this constituent resides. Possible types:

 ** RAID0
 ** RAID4
 ** RAID-DP
 ** RAID-TEC

* *Capacity (free/total)*
+
The total storage available on the constituent, in gigabytes, and the amount of storage currently available.
