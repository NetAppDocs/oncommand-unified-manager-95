The Performance/Clusters inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each cluster that is monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This page enables you to monitor the performance of your clusters, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to this page, a different title may be displayed on the page to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all clusters, the title is "`Clusters`". When displaying a subset of clusters that are returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`Clusters on which policy XYZ is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

== Clusters inventory page columns

The Performance/Clusters inventory page contains the following columns for each cluster.

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Cluster*
+
The name of the cluster. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's performance details page.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second on the cluster.

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the cluster, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity for this cluster, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity for this cluster, in gigabytes.

* *Node Count*
+
The number of nodes in the cluster. You can click the node count number to navigate to the Performance/Nodes inventory page.

* *Host Name or IP Address*
+
The host name or IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the cluster management LIF.

* *Serial #*
+
The unique identification number of the cluster.

* *OS Version*
+
The version of ONTAP software that is installed on the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
If different versions of ONTAP software are installed on the nodes in the cluster, the lowest version number is listed. You can view the ONTAP version that is installed on each node from the Performance/Nodes inventory page.
====

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
