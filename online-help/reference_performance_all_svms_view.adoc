The Performance/SVMs inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each storage virtual machine (SVM) that is being monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This enables you to quickly monitor the performance of your SVMs, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to this page, the top of the page may display a different title to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all SVMs, the title is "`SVMs`". When displaying a subset of SVMs that is returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`SVMs on which policy: SVM_IOPS is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

[NOTE]
====
The SVMs that are listed on this page include only Data and Cluster SVMs. Unified Manager does not use or display Admin or Node SVMs.

== SVMs inventory page columns

The Performance/SVMs inventory page contains the following columns for each SVM:

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *SVM*
+
You can click the SVM name to navigate to that SVM's performance details page.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second for the SVM.

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the SVM, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity ofr the SVM, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity of the SVM, in gigabytes.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the SVM belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
