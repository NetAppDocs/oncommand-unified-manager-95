The Performance/LIFs inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each LIF that is being monitored by this instance of Unified Manager. This page enables you to quickly monitor the performance of your LIFs, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to the Performance/LIFs inventory page, the top of the page may display a different title to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all LIFs, the title is "`LIFs`". When displaying a subset of LIFs that is returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`LIFs on which policy: LIF_IOPS is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

[NOTE]
====
The LIFs that are listed on the Performance/LIFs inventory page include Data LIFs, Cluster LIFs, Node Management LIFs, and Intercluster LIFs. Unified Manager does not use or display System LIFs.

== LIFs inventory page columns

The Performance/LIFs inventory page contains the following columns for each LIF.

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *LIF*
+
You can click the LIF name to navigate to the performance details page of that LIF.

* *Type*
+
The LIF type: Network (iSCSI, NFS, CIFS), FCP, or NVMf FCP.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests, expressed in milliseconds per operation. Latency is not applicable to NFS LIFs and CIFS LIFs, and is displayed as N/A for these types.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second. IOPS is not applicable to NFS LIFs and CIFS LIFs, and is displayed as N/A for these types.

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the LIF, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the LIF belongs. You can click the cluster's name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *SVM*
+
The storage virtual machine to which the LIF belongs. You can click the SVM name to navigate to that SVM's details page.

* *Home Location*
+
The home location for the LIF, displayed as node name and port name, separated by a colon (:). If the location is displayed with an ellipsis (...), you can position your cursor over the location name to view the full location.

* *Current Location*
+
The current location for the LIF, displayed as node name and port name, separated by a colon (:). If the location is displayed with an ellipsis (...), you can position your cursor over the location name to view the full location.

* *Role*
+
The LIF role: Data, Cluster, Node Management, or Intercluster.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
