[.lead]
You can edit existing protection relationships to change the maximum transfer rate, the protection policy, or the protection schedule. You might edit a relationship to decrease the bandwidth used for transfers, or to increase the frequency of scheduled transfers because data is changing often.

== Before you begin

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== About this task

The selected volumes must be protection relationship destinations. You cannot edit relationships when source volumes, load-sharing volumes, or volumes that are not the destination of a SnapMirror or SnapVault relationship are selected.

== Steps

. From the *Protection/Volume Relationships* page, select in the volumes list one or more volumes in the same SVM for which you want to edit relationship settings, and then select *Edit* from the toolbar.
+
The Edit Relationship dialog box is displayed.

. In the *Edit Relationship* dialog box, edit the maximum transfer rate, protection policy, or protection schedule, as needed.
. Click *Apply*.
+
The changes are applied to the selected relationships.
