You might generate a new HTTPS security certificate for multiple reasons, including if you want to sign with a different Certificate Authority or if the current security certificate has expired. The new certificate replaces the existing certificate.

== Before you begin

You must have the OnCommand Administrator role.

== About this task

If you do not have access to the Unified Manager web UI, you can regenerate the HTTPS certificate with the same values using the maintenance console.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage_settings_icon.gif[]*, and then click *HTTPS Certificate* from the *Setup* menu.
. Click *Regenerate HTTPS Certificate*.
+
The Regenerate HTTPS Certificate dialog box is displayed.

. Select one of the following options depending on how you want to generate the certificate:
+
|===
| If you want to...| Do this...
a|
Regenerate the certificate with the current values
a|
Click the *Regenerate Using Current Certificate Attributes* option.
a|
Generate the certificate using different values
a|
    Click the *Update the Current Certificate Attributes* option.
+
The Common Name and Alternative Names fields will use the values from the existing certificate if you do not enter new values. The other fields do not require values, but you can enter values, for example, for the City, State, and Country if you want those values to be populated in the certificate.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can select the "`Exclude local identifying information (e.g. localhost)`" checkbox if you want to remove the local identifying information from the Alternative Names field in the certificate. When this checkbox is selected only what you enter in the field is used in the Alternative Names field. When left blank the resulting certificate will not have an Alternative Names field at all.
====
+
|===

. Click *Yes* to regenerate the certificate.
. Restart the Unified Manager server so that the new certificate takes effect.

== After you finish

Verify the new certificate information by viewing the HTTPS certificate.
