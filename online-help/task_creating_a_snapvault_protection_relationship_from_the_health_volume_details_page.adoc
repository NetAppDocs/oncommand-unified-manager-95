You can create a SnapVault relationship using the Health/Volume details page so that data backups are enabled for protection purposes on volumes.

== Before you begin

* You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.
* You must have set up Workflow Automation to perform this task.

== About this task

The *Protect* menu does not display in the following instances:

* If RBAC settings do not allow this action: for example, if you have only operator privileges
* When the volume ID is unknown: for example, when you have a intercluster relationship and the destination cluster has not yet been discovered

== Steps

. In the *Protection* tab of the *Health/Volume* details page, right-click a volume in the topology view that you want to protect.
. Select *Protect* > *SnapVault* from the menu.
+
The Configure Protection dialog box is launched.

. Click *SnapVault* to view the *SnapVault* tab and to configure the secondary resource information.
. Click *Advanced* to set deduplication, compression, autogrow, and space guarantee as needed, and then click *Apply*.
. Complete the *Destination Information* area and the *Relationship Settings* area in the *Configure Protection* dialog box.
. Click *Apply*.
+
You are returned to the Health/Volume details page.

. Click the protection configuration job link at the top of the *Health/Volume* details page.
+
The Protection/Job details page is displayed.

. Click *Refresh* to update the tasks list and task details associated with the protection configuration job and to determine when the job is complete.
+
When the job tasks are complete, the new relationships are displayed in the Health/Volume details page topology view.
