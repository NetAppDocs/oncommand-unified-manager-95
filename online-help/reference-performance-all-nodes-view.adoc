The Performance/Nodes inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each node that is being monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This enables you to quickly monitor the performance of your nodes, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to this page, the top of the page may display a different title to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all nodes, the title is "`Nodes`". When displaying a subset of nodes that is returned from the Cluster Inventory page, the title is "`Nodes on cluster: opm-cluster2`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

== Nodes inventory page columns

The Performance/Nodes inventory page contains the following columns for each node:

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Node*
+
The name of the node. You can click the node name to navigate to that node's performance details page.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests on the node, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *IOPS*
+
The average input/output operations per second on the node.

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the node, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Flash Cache Reads*
+
The percentage of read operations on the node that are satisfied by cache, instead of being returned from the disk.
+
[NOTE]
====
Flash Cache data is displayed only for nodes, and only when a Flash Cache module is installed in the node.
====

* *Performance Capacity Used*
+
The percentage of performance capacity that is being consumed by the node.
+
[NOTE]
====
Performance capacity data is available only when the nodes in a cluster are installed with ONTAP 9.0 or later software.
====

* *Utilization*
+
Indicates whether the CPU or memory on the node is being overused.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity of the node, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity of the node, in gigabytes.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the node belongs. You can click the cluster's name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
