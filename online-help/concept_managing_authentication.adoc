You can enable authentication using either LDAP or Active Directory on the Unified Manager server and configure it to work with your servers to authenticate remote users.

Additionally, you can enable SAML authentication so that remote users are authenticated through a secure identity provider (IdP) before they can log into the Unified Manager web UI.
