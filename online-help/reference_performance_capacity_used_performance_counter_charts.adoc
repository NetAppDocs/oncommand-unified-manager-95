The Performance ExplorerPerformance Capacity Used counter charts display the percentage of performance capacity that is being consumed by the node or aggregate.

[NOTE]
====
Performance capacity data is available only when the nodes in a cluster are installed with ONTAP 9.0 or later software.
====

These charts apply only when the selected object is a node or aggregate.

The popup window that is displayed when your cursor is in the chart area shows the specific counter values at specific times.

The bottom of the chart page displays information for the minimum, maximum, average, and 95th percentile performance capacity used for the selected time range.

There are two types of Performance Capacity Used charts available:

== Performance Capacity Used - Total counter chart

Displays the percentage of performance capacity that is being consumed by the node or aggregate.

* Green zone
+
The capacity value is under the warning threshold set in Unified Manager.

* Yellow zone
+
The capacity value is approaching the warning threshold set in Unified Manager.

* Red zone
+
The capacity value is above the warning threshold and approaching the maximum threshold set in Unified Manager.

== Performance Capacity Used - Breakdown counter chart

Displays the same percentage of performance capacity separated into user protocols, system background processes, and the amount of free performance capacity.

== *Zoom View* button

Displays a magnified view of the counter chart data.

* Events
+
The occurrence of critical, warning, and informational events are indicated on the time lines above the charts.

* Thresholds
+
The dashed, horizontal line indicates the capacity warning threshold value set in Unified Manager.
+
The solid red line indicates the capacity critical threshold value set in Unified Manager.
+
The solid black line at 100% is the recommended maximum performance capacity used value.

* Counters
+
The counters in the left pane show which counter values are being displayed. Deselecting or selecting the image:../media/eye_icon.gif[] that is associated with a counter can restrict the comparison.
