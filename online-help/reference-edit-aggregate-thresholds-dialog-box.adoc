[.lead]
You can configure alerts to send notifications when an event related to an aggregate's capacity is generated, and you can take corrective actions for the event. For example, for the Aggregate Full threshold, you can configure an alert to send notification when the condition persists over a specified period.

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

The Edit Aggregate Thresholds dialog box enables you to configure aggregate-level thresholds that are applied to selected aggregates. If you configure aggregate-level thresholds, they take priority over the global-level threshold values. You can configure threshold settings for capacity, growth, and Snapshot copies at the aggregate level. If these settings are not configured, the global threshold values are applied.

[NOTE]
====
The threshold values are not applicable to the root aggregate of the node.
====

== Capacity area

The Capacity area enables you to set the following aggregate capacity threshold conditions:

* *Space Nearly Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which an aggregate is considered to be nearly full. It also displays the size of the aggregate corresponding to the specified threshold value.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

* *Space Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which an aggregate is considered full. It also displays the size of the aggregate corresponding to the specified threshold value.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

* *Nearly Overcommitted*
+
Specifies the percentage at which an aggregate is considered to be nearly overcommitted.

* *Overcommitted*
+
Specifies the percentage at which an aggregate is considered to be overcommitted.

* *Days Until Full*
+
Specifies the number of days remaining before the aggregate reaches full capacity.

== Growth area

The Growth area enables you to set the following threshold condition for aggregate growth:

* *Growth Rate*
+
Specifies the percentage at which an aggregate's growth rate is considered to be normal before the system generates an Aggregate Growth Rate Abnormal event.

* *Growth Rate Sensitivity*
+
Specifies the factor that is applied to the standard deviation of an aggregate's growth rate. If the growth rate exceeds the factored standard deviation, an Aggregate Growth Rate Abnormal event is generated.
+
A lower value for growth rate sensitivity indicates that the aggregate is highly sensitive to changes in the growth rate.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you modify the growth rate sensitivity for aggregates at the global threshold level, the change is also applied to the growth rate sensitivity for volumes at the global threshold level.
====

== Snapshot copies area

The Snapshot copies area enables you to set the following Snapshot reserve threshold conditions:

* *Snapshot Reserve Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which an aggregate has consumed all its space reserved for Snapshot copies.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following tasks for a selected aggregate:

* *Restore to Defaults*
+
Enables you to restore the aggregate-level threshold values to the global values.

* *Save*
+
Saves all the threshold settings.

* *Save and Close*
+
Saves all the threshold settings and then closes the dialog box.

* *Cancel*
+
Ignores the changes (if any) to the threshold settings and closes the dialog box.
