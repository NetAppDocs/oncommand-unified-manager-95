You can view the volumes and LUNs that you have subscribed to the "`Performance Guarantee`" program to verify that latency has not exceeded the level you have been guaranteed.

== About this task

The latency performance guarantee is a millisecond per operation value that should not be exceeded. It is based on an hourly average, not on the default five minute performance collection period.

== Steps

. In the *Performance Volumes* or *Performance LUNs* inventory page, select the volume or LUN that you are interested in.
. In the *Performance Explorer* page for your selected volume or LUN, choose *Hourly Average* from the *View statistics in* selector.
+
The horizontal line in the Latency chart will show a smoother line as the five-minute collections are replaced with the hourly average.

. If you have other volumes on the same aggregate that are under the performance guarantee, you can add those volumes to view their latency value in the same chart.
