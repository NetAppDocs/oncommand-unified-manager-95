A rule template is a predefined template that can be used to create rules in a data policy. A rule template enables you to create a rule based on three categories: owner, file type, and directory path.

== Example of a rule template for file types

The rule template "`Place all files with the specified extensions in a suitable storage class`" places all the .mp3 files that are written to the Infinite Volume in a storage class that you specify.
