The Namespaces inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each Namespace that is being monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This enables you to quickly monitor the performance and health of your Namespaces, and to troubleshoot issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to this page, the top of the page may display a different title to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all Namespaces, the title is "`Namespaces`". When displaying a subset of Namespaces that is returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`Namespaces on which policy: Namespace_IOPS is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

== Namespaces inventory page columns

The Namespaces inventory page contains the following columns for each Namespace:

* *Subsystem*
+
The subsystem of the Namespace.

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Namespace*
+
You can click the Namespace name to navigate to that Namespace's performance details page.

* *State*
+
The current state of the Namespace.

 ** Offline - Read or write access to the Namespace is not allowed.
 ** Online - Read and write access to the Namespace is allowed.
 ** NVFail - The Namespace was automatically taken offline due to an NVRAM failure.
 ** Space Error - The Namespace has run out of space.

* *SVM*
+
The storage virtual machine (SVM) to which the Namespace belongs. You can click the SVM name to navigate to that SVM's details page.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the Namespace belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Volume*
+
The volume to which the Namespace belongs. You can click the volume name to navigate to that volume's details page.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity of the Namespace, in gigabytes.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity of the Namespace, in gigabytes.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second for the Namespace.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests on the Namespace, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the Namespace, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
