You can change the identity provider (IdP) that Unified Manager uses to authenticate remote users.

== Before you begin

* You must have the IdP URL and metadata.
* You must have access to the IdP.

== About this task

The new IdP can be configured before or after configuring Unified Manager.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Authentication* in the left Setup menu.
. In the *Setup/Authentication* page, select the *SAML Authentication* tab.
. Enter the new IdP URI and the IdP metadata required to connect the Unified Manager server to the IdP.
+
If the IdP is accessible directly from the Unified Manager server, you can click the *Fetch IdP Metadata* button after entering the IdP URL to populate the IdP Metadata field automatically.

. Copy the Unified Manager metadata URI, or save the metadata to an XML text file.
. Click *Save Configuration*.
+
A message box displays to confirm that you want to change the configuration.

. Click *OK*.

== After you finish

Access the new IdP and enter the Unified Manager server URI and metadata to complete the configuration.

The next time authorized remote users attempt to access the Unified Manager graphical interface they will enter their credentials in the new IdP login page instead of the old IdP login page.
