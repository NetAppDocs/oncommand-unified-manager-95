Use this page to view a list of the physical and logical attributes of the volume. This information might help in answering performance-related questions. The title of this page depends on whether you are viewing a FlexVol volume or a FlexGroup volume.

== Volume attributes

* *Type*
+
The volume's type; either read-write (RW) or data-protection (DP).

* *Style*
+
The style of volume; either FlexVol or FlexGroup.
+
[NOTE]
====
The performance pages of Unified Manager do not support Infinite Volumes.
====

* *Cluster*
+
The name of the cluster to which this FlexVol volume or FlexGroup volume belongs. You can click the name to display cluster details in the Performance/Cluster Explorer page.

* *Aggregates*
+
The name of the aggregate on which this FlexVol volume resides, or the number of aggregates on which this FlexGroup volume resides.
+
For FlexVol volumes, you can click the name to display aggregate details in the Performance/Aggregate Explorer page. For FlexGroup volumes, you can click the number to display the aggregates that are used in this FlexGroup volume in the Performance/Aggregate Inventory page.

* *Storage Virtual Machine*
+
The name of the SVM to which this FlexVol volume or FlexGroup volume belongs. You can click the name to display SVM details in the Performance/SVM Explorer page.

* *Tiering Policy*
+
The tiering policy set on the volume. The policy takes affect only when the volume is deployed on a FabricPool aggregate. The available policies are:

 ** None. The data for this volume always remains on the performance tier.
 ** Snapshot Only. Only Snapshot data is moved automatically to the cloud tier. All other data remains on the performance tier.
 ** Backup. On data protection volumes, all transferred user data starts in the cloud tier, but later client reads can cause hot data to move to the performance tier.
 ** Auto. Data on this volume is moved between the performance tier and the cloud tier automatically when ONTAP determines that the data is "`hot`" or "`cold`".

* *RAID Type*
+
The redundancy type that is being used on the performance tier of the aggregate where this volume resides. Possible types:

 ** RAID0
 ** RAID4
 ** RAID-DP
 ** RAID-TEC

+
[NOTE]
====
The value "`Not Applicable`" is displayed for FlexGroup volumes because the constituent volumes can be on aggregates of different RAID types.
====

* *Capacity (free/total)*
+
The total storage available on the volume, in gigabytes, and the amount of storage currently available.
