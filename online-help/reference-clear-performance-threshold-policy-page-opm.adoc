You can use the Clear Threshold Policy page to remove, or _clear_, a performance threshold policy from one or more storage objects.

The list of policies is populated with only those policies that are being used in the selected object or objects.

You select the policy that you want to remove from the storage object or objects, and then you click *Clear Policy*.
