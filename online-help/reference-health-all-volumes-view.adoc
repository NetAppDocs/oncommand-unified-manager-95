[.lead]
The Health/Volumes inventory page displays information about the volumes in the storage systems that are monitored and enables you to modify the volume threshold settings.

== Command buttons

* *Edit Thresholds*
+
Displays the Edit Thresholds dialog box, which enables you to edit the health threshold settings for one or more volumes.

* *Protect*
+
Displays the following submenus:

 ** SnapMirror
+
Enables you to create a SnapMirror relationship for the selected volumes.

 ** SnapVault
+
Enables you to create a SnapVault relationship for the selected volumes.

* *Restore*
+
Displays the Restore dialog box, which enables you to restore directories or files from one volume at a time.
+
This button is disabled if more than one volume is selected, or if a FlexGroup volume is selected, or if a volume configured for SnapMirror Synchronous is selected.

* *Annotate*
+
Enables you to annotate the selected volume.

* *Export*
+
Enables you to export the details of all the monitored volumes to a comma-separated values (`.csv`) file. When viewing Infinite Volumes, the Infinite Volume constituents will be exported.

== Volumes Overview table

The volumes table displays the properties of all the discovered volumes. You can use the column filters to customize the data that is displayed:

* *Status*
+
The current status of a volume. The status can be Critical (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), Error (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), Warning (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]), or Normal (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]).
+
You can move the pointer over the status to view more information about the event or events generated for the volume.
+
If the status of the volume is determined by a single event, you can view information such as the event name, time and date when the event was triggered, the name of the administrator to whom the event is assigned, and the cause of the event. You can click the *View Details* link to view more information about the event.
+
If the status of the volume is determined by multiple events of the same severity, the top three events are displayed with information such as the event name, time and date when the events are triggered, and the name of the administrator to whom the event is assigned. You can view more details about each of these events by clicking the event name. You can also click the *View All Events* link to view the list of generated events.

* *Volume*
+
The name of the volume.
+
You can move the pointer over a volume to view information such as the qtree quota overcommitted space, status of the last volume move operation, and space allocated in the volume. You can also view the details of related objects such as the SVM to which the volume belongs, the aggregate to which the volume belongs, and all the volumes that belong to this aggregate.
+
If an SVM with Infinite Volume is monitored, you can view details about the three types of constituents (data, namespace, and namespace mirror) in the SVM with Infinite Volume. The constituent details include the following information:

 ** Constituent name
 ** State of the constituent
 ** Name of the SVM with Infinite Volume to which the constituent belongs
 ** Junction path of the constituent
 ** Name of the aggregate that contains the constituent
 ** Available, used, and total data capacity of the constituent

* *State*
+
The current state of the volume:

 ** Offline
+
Read or write access to the volume is not allowed.

 ** Online
+
Read and write access to the volume is allowed.

 ** Restricted
+
Limited operations, such as parity reconstruction, are allowed, but data access is not allowed.

 ** Mixed
+
The constituents of a FlexGroup volume are not all in the same state.

* *Junction Path*
+
The path to which the volume is mounted.

* *Storage Virtual Machine*
+
The SVM that contains the volume.

* *Aggregates*
+
The name of the aggregate on which the volume resides, or the number of aggregates on which the FlexGroup volume resides.
+
You can click the name to display details in the Aggregate details page. For FlexGroup volumes, you can click the number to display the aggregates that are used in the FlexGroup in the Aggregates page.

* *Tiering Policy*
+
The tiering policy set on the volume. The policy takes affect only when the volume is deployed on a FabricPool aggregate:

 ** None. The data for this volume always remains on the performance tier.
 ** Snapshot-Only. Only Snapshot data is moved automatically to the cloud tier. All other data remains on the performance tier.
 ** Backup. On data protection volumes, all transferred user data starts in the cloud tier, but later client reads can cause hot data to move to the performance tier.
 ** Auto. Data on this volume is moved between the performance tier and the cloud tier automatically when ONTAP determines that the data is "`hot`" or "`cold`".

* *SnapLock Type*
+
The SnapLock Type of the aggregate that contains the volume. The available options are Compliance, Enterprise, Non-SnapLock.

* *In Transition*
+
Whether the volume has completed transition or not.

* *Protection Role*
+
The protection role of a volume:

 ** Unprotected
+
A read/write volume with no outgoing or incoming SnapMirror or SnapVault relationships

 ** Protected
+
A read/write volume with an outgoing SnapMirror or SnapVault relationship

 ** Destination
+
A data protection (DP) volume or read/write volume with an incoming SnapMirror or SnapVault relationship

 ** Not Applicable
+
A volume for which protection roles do not apply, such as a load sharing volume, data constituent, or temporary volume
+
You can move your pointer over the protection role for a volume to display a graphical representation of the protection topology for the selected volume. This may include the source volume, the total number of outgoing synchronous and asynchronous SnapMirror relationships, and the total number of outgoing SnapVault relationships. Blue highlighting around the volume indicates the selected volume.
+
Clicking *View Protection Details* displays the Protection tab of the Health/Volume details page.

* *Thin Provisioned*
+
Whether space guarantee is set for the selected volume. Valid values are Yes and No.

* *Available Data Capacity*
+
The amount of physical space currently available for data in the volume.

* *Available Data %*
+
The percentage of physical space currently available for data in the volume.

* *Used Data Capacity*
+
The amount of physical space used by data in the volume.

* *Used Data %*
+
The percentage of physical space used by data in the volume based on the total available data capacity.

* *Logical Space Used %*
+
The percentage of logical space used by data in the volume based on the total available data capacity.

* *Logical Space Reporting*
+
Whether the volume has logical space reporting configured. The value can be Enabled, Disabled, or Not applicable.
+
Logical space indicates the real size of the data that is being stored on the volume without applying the savings from using ONTAP storage efficiency technologies.

* *Total Data Capacity*
+
The total physical space available for data in the volume.

* *Storage Class*
+
The storage class name. This column is displayed for Infinite Volume only.

* *Constituent Role*
+
The role name of the constituent. The roles can be Namespace, Data, or Namespace Mirror. This column is displayed for Infinite Volumes only.

* *Move Status*
+
The current status of the volume move operation. The status can be In Progress, Paused, Failed, or Completed.
+
You can move the pointer over the status to view more information about the volume move operation, such as the source, destination, operation start time, operation end time, current phase of the volume move operation that is in progress, status (in percentage), and estimated end time.

* *Caching Policy*
+
The caching policy that is associated with the selected volume. The policy provides information about how the Flash Pool caching occurs for the volume.
