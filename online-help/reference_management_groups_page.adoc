The Management/Groups page enables you to create groups in Unified Manager to easily manage storage objects. A group is a dynamic collection of storage objects (clusters, volumes, and SVMs), which is defined by the group rules you create for the group.

The Management/Groups page includes tabs that enable you to add, delete, or edit a group, group rules, and group actions. When you log in as an operator, you will have only read access to the page. You can access the add, edit, or delete buttons in each tab when you log in as a storage administrator or Unified Manager administrator.
