The Performance Explorer Available IOPS counter chart displays the number of input/output operations per second that are currently available (free) on the selected storage object.

The popup window that is displayed when your cursor is in the chart area shows the specific counter values at specific times.

This chart option applies only when the selected object is a node or aggregate.

The bottom of the chart page displays information for the minimum, maximum, average, and 95th percentile performance capacity used for the selected time range.

== Available IOPS - Total counter chart

Displays the number of input/output operations per second that are currently available (free) on the selected storage object. This number is the result of subtracting the currently used IOPS from the total IOPS that Unified Manager calculates that the object can perform.

[NOTE]
====
Available IOPS data is available only when the nodes in a cluster are installed with ONTAP 9.0 or later software.
