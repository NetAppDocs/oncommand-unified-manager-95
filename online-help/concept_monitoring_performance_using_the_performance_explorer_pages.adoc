The Performance Explorer pages display detailed information about the performance of each object in a cluster. The page provides a detailed view into the performance of all cluster objects, enabling you to select and compare the performance data of specific objects across various time periods.

You can also assess the overall performance of all objects, and compare object performance data in a side-by-side format.

If an object is no longer managed by Unified Manager, the status *Removed* is displayed to the right of the object's name at the top of the Performance Explorer page.
