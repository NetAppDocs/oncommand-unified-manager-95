The Performance/Volumes inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, counter data, and configuration information for each FlexVol volume and FlexGroup volume that is being monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This enables you to quickly monitor the performance of your volumes, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

Depending on how you navigate to this page, the top of the page may display a different title to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all volumes, the title is "`Volumes`". When displaying a subset of volumes that is returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`Volumes on which policy: vol_IOPS is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

[NOTE]
====
For data protection (DP) volumes, only counter values for user-generated traffic are displayed. When the cluster is installed with a version of ONTAP software prior to 8.3, no counter values are displayed.
====

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

[NOTE]
====
Root volumes are not displayed on this page.

== Volume inventory page columns

The Performance/Volumes inventory page contains the following columns for each volume:

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Volume*
+
The volume name. You can click the volume name to navigate to the volume's performance details page.

* *Style*
+
The style of volume; either FlexVol or FlexGroup.

* *Latency*
+
For FlexVol volumes, this is the average response time of the volume for all I/O requests, expressed in milliseconds per operation. For FlexGroup volumes, this is the average latency of all constituent volumes.

* *IOPS*
+
For FlexVol volumes, this is the number of input/output operations per second for the volume. For FlexGroup volumes, this is the sum of IOPS for all constituent volumes.

* *MBps*
+
For FlexVol volumes, this is the throughput on the volume, measured in megabytes per second. For FlexGroup volumes, this is the sum of MBps for all constituent volumes.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity of the volume, expressed in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity of the volume, expressed in gigabytes.

* *Tiering Policy*
+
The tiering policy set on the volume. The policy takes affect only when the volume is deployed on a FabricPool aggregate. The available policies are:

 ** None. The data for this volume always remains on the performance tier.
 ** Snapshot Only. Only Snapshot data is moved automatically to the cloud tier. All other data remains on the performance tier.
 ** Backup. On data protection volumes, all transferred user data starts in the cloud tier, but later client reads can cause hot data to move back to the performance tier.
 ** Auto. Data on this volume is moved between the performance tier and the cloud tier automatically when ONTAP determines that the data is "`hot`" or "`cold`".

* *Cold Data*
+
The size of the user data stored on the volume that is inactive (cold).
+
The value is listed as "`N/A`" in the following situations:

 ** When "`inactive data reporting`" is disabled on the aggregate on which the volume resides.
 ** When "`inactive data reporting`" is enabled, but the minimum number of days for collecting data has not been reached.
 ** When using the "`backup`" tiering policy, or when using a version of ONTAP prior to 9.4 (when inactive data reporting is not available).

* *Cloud Recommendation*
+
Unified Manager runs capacity analysis on each volume to determine if you can improve your storage system's disk utilization and save space on the performance tier by moving inactive (cold) data to the cloud tier. When the recommendation is "`Tier`", hover your cursor over the word *Tier* to view the recommendation. Possible recommendations are:

 ** Learning. Not enough data has been collected to make a recommendation.
 ** Tier. Analysis has determined that the volume contains inactive (cold) data and that you should configure the volume to move that data to the cloud tier.
 ** No Action. Either the volume has very little inactive data, or the volume is already set to the "`auto`" tiering policy, or the version of ONTAP does not support FabricPool.
If you are logged in to Unified Manager with the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role, when you hover your cursor over the word *Tier* the *Configure Volume* link is available to launch System Manager so you can make the recommended change.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the volume belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Node*
+
The name of the node on which the FlexVol volume resides, or the number of nodes on which the FlexGroup volume resides.
+
For FlexVol volumes, you can click the name to display node details in the Node details page. For FlexGroup volumes, you can click the number to display the nodes that are used in the FlexGroup in the Nodes inventory page.

* *SVM*
+
The storage virtual machine (SVM) to which the volume belongs. You can click the SVM name to navigate to that SVM's details page.

* *Aggregate*
+
The name of the aggregate on which the FlexVol volume resides, or the number of aggregates on which the FlexGroup volume resides.
+
For FlexVol volumes, you can click the name to display aggregate details in the Aggregate details page. For FlexGroup volumes, you can click the number to display the aggregates that are used in the FlexGroup in the Aggregates inventory page.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
