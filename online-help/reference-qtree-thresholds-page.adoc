The Configuration/Health Thresholds page for Qtrees enables you to configure global health threshold values for monitored qtrees. Events are generated for a qtree only when a Qtree quota or a Default quota has been set on the qtree. Events are not generated if the space defined in a User quota or Group quota has exceeded the threshold.
