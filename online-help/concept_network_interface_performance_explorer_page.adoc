Using the View and Compare functionality you can compare the performance of this LIF with:

* other LIFs that are on the same port
* other LIFs that are on the same SVM
* the port on which the LIF resides
* the SVM on which the LIF resides

The Performance/LIF Explorer page enables you to:

* View threshold-related issues and their details
* Track and compare LIF performance data
* Investigate and troubleshoot threshold-related issues
* Investigate and troubleshoot performance issues
