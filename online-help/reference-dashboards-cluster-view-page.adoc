The Dashboards/Cluster View page displays overview information about the clusters you are managing.

Clicking *Manage Clusters* takes you to the Configuration/Cluster Data Sources page.

Clicking on a cluster displays overview information on the monitoring status, capacity status, and performance status of the cluster.

The Cluster View dashboard consists of two major sections: Managed Clusters (on the left) and Cluster Details (on the right).

== Managed Clusters section

Lists all the clusters the Unified Manager is monitoring. The following details are provided for each cluster in the list:

* Cluster status icon: The status can be Critical (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), Error (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), Warning (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]), or Normal (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]).
* IP address or host name: Provides the host name of the cluster, and the IP address or FQDN.
* Cluster Health: Provides information about the health of the cluster as monitored by Unified Manager.
+
The health status can have one of the following values: OK, OK with suppressed, Degraded, and Components not reachable.

== Cluster Details section

Provides information about the monitoring status, capacity, and performance of the selected cluster.

* Monitoring Status: Displays the ongoing health and performance monitoring status.
+
The monitoring status can have the following values: Discovering, Poll completed, Poll failed, or Not available. The monitoring status displays an error message when the corresponding monitoring job (health or performance) fails.

* Capacity: Displays the total, used, and free storage capacity of the selected cluster.
* Performance: Displays the average operating speed of the cluster in number of IOPS (input/output operations per second), and the average throughput of the selected cluster in MBps (megabytes per second).

The Details section also provides navigation links to the individual cluster details pages of the OnCommand Unified Manager applications:

* The Health link navigates to the Health/Cluster details page of the selected cluster.
* The Performance link navigates to the Performance/Cluster details page of the selected cluster.
* The System Manager link navigates to the login page for OnCommand System Manager so that you can manage cluster settings.
