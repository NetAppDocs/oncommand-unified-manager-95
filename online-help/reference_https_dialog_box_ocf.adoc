[.lead]
The HTTPS Certificate page enables you to view the current security certificate, download a certificate signing request, generate a new HTTPS certificate, or install a new HTTPS certificate.

If you have not generated a new HTTPS certificate, the certificate that appears on this page is the certificate that was generated during installation.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following operations:

* *Download HTTPS Certificate Signing Request*
+
Downloads a certification request for the currently installed HTTPS certificate. Your browser prompts you to save the `<hostname>.csr` file so that you can provide the file to a Certificate Authority to sign.

* *Install HTTPS Certificate*
+
Enables you to upload and install a security certificate after a Certificate Authority has signed and returned it. The new certificate is in effect after you restart the management server.

* *Regenerate HTTPS Certificate*
+
Enables you to generate an HTTPS certificate, which replaces the current security certificate. The new certificate is in effect after you restart Unified Manager.
