You can use Unified Manager to analyze a performance event for a MetroCluster configuration. You can identify the workloads involved in the event and review the suggested actions for resolving it.

MetroCluster performance events might be due to _bully_ workloads that are over-utilizing the interswitch links (ISLs) between the clusters, or due to link health issues. Unified Manager monitors each cluster in a MetroCluster configuration independently, without consideration of performance events on a partner cluster.

Performance events from both clusters in the MetroCluster configuration are also displayed on the Unified ManagerDashboards/Overview page.You can also view the Health pages of Unified Manager to check the health of each cluster and to view their relationship.
