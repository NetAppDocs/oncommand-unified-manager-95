The Performance/Constituent Volume Explorer page provides detailed performance information for the selected FlexGroup constituent.

The Performance/Constituent Volume Explorer page enables you to track and compare constituent performance during a specific time period, which helps in troubleshooting and fine-tuning the performance of a FlexGroup volume and its constituent volumes.

Using the View and Compare functionality you can compare the performance of this constituent volume with:

* the aggregate on which this constituent volume resides
* the SVM on which this constituent volume resides
* the FlexGroup volume to which the constituent volume belongs
* other volumes that are on the same aggregate

The Performance/Constituent Volume Explorer page enables you to:

* View threshold-related issues and their details
* Track and compare constituent performance data
* Investigate and troubleshoot threshold-related issues
* Investigate and troubleshoot performance issues

[NOTE]
====
For data protection (DP) volumes, only counter values for user-generated traffic are displayed. When the cluster is installed with a version of ONTAP software prior to 8.3, no counter values are displayed.
