The Performance/SVM Explorer page provides a detailed performance overview of all the storage virtual machines (SVMs) in a cluster.

The Performance/SVM Explorer page enables you to track and compare SVM performance during a specific time period, which helps you to troubleshoot and fine-tune your SVM performance.

Using the View and Compare functionality you can compare the performance of this SVM with:

* other SVMs on the same cluster
* the volumes on this SVM
* the LIFs on this SVM

The Performance/SVM Explorer page enables you to:

* View threshold-related issues and their details
* Track and compare SVM performance data
* Investigate and troubleshoot threshold-related issues
* Investigate and troubleshoot performance issues
