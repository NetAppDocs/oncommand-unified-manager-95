[.lead]
You can configure alerts to send notifications when an event related to a qtree's capacity is generated, and you can take corrective actions for the event. For example, for the Qtree Full threshold, you can configure an alert to send notification when the condition persists over a specified period.

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

The Edit Qtree Thresholds dialog box enables you to configure qtree-level thresholds that are applied to the selected qtrees. When thresholds are configured at the qtree level, they take priority over the group-level thresholds or the global-level threshold values.

You can configure threshold settings for capacity at the qtree level. When a group action of qtree threshold type is configured, the group action threshold values are used for settings that are not configured at the qtree level. When no group action of qtree threshold type is configured, areas in Edit Qtree Thresholds dialog box that are not configured, use global threshold values.

== Capacity area

The Capacity area enables you to set the following qtree capacity threshold conditions:

* *Space Nearly Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a qtree is considered to be nearly full. It also displays the size of the qtree corresponding to the specified threshold value.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

* *Space Full*
+
Specifies the percentage at which a qtree is considered full. It also displays the size of the qtree corresponding to the specified threshold value.
+
You can also use the slider to set the threshold value.

== Command buttons

The command buttons enable you to perform the following tasks for a selected qtree:

* *Restore to Defaults*
+
Enables you to restore the threshold values to one of the following:

 ** Group values, if the qtree belongs to a group and that group has a qtree threshold action type.
 ** Global values, if the qtree does not belong to any group or if it belongs to a group that does not have a qtree threshold action type.

* *Save*
+
Saves all the threshold settings.

* *Save and Close*
+
Saves all the threshold settings and then closes the dialog box.

* *Cancel*
+
Ignores the changes (if any) to the threshold settings and closes the dialog box.
