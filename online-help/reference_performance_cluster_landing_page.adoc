The Performance Cluster Landing page displays the high-level performance status of a selected cluster. The page enables you to access complete details of each performance counter for the storage objects on the selected cluster.

You can click the *Favorites* button (image:../media/favorites_inactive.png[]) to add this object to your list of favorite storage objects. A blue button (image:../media/favorites_active.png[]) indicates that this object is already a favorite.

The Performance Cluster Landing page includes four tabs that separate the cluster details into four areas of information:

* Summary page
 ** Cluster Events pane
 ** Managed Objects pane
* Top Performers page
* Explorer page
* Information page
