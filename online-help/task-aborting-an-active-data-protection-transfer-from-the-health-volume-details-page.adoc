You can abort an active data protection transfer when you want to stop a SnapMirror replication that is in progress. You can also clear the restart checkpoint for a transfer if it is not a baseline transfer. You might abort a transfer when it conflicts with another operation, such as a volume move.

== Before you begin

* You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role..
* You must have set up Workflow Automation.

== About this task

The abort action does not display in the following instances:

* If RBAC settings do not allow this action: for example, if you have only operator privileges
* When the volume ID is unknown: for example, when you have an intercluster relationship and the destination cluster has not yet been discovered

You cannot clear the restart checkpoint for a baseline transfer.

== Steps

. In the *Protection* tab of the *Health/Volume* details page, right-click the relationship in the topology view for the data transfer you want to abort and select *Abort*.
+
The Abort Transfer dialog box is displayed.

. If you want to clear the restart checkpoint for a transfer that is not a baseline transfer, select *Clear Checkpoints*.
. Click *Continue*.
+
The Abort Transfer dialog box is closed, and the status of the abort operation displays at the top of the Health/Volume details page along with a link to the job details.

. Click the *View details* link to go to the *Protection/Job* details page for additional details and to view job progress.
. Click each job task to view its details.
. Click the Back arrow on your browser to return to the *Health/Volume* details page.
+
The abort operation is finished when all job tasks successfully complete.
