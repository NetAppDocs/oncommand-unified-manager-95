The Performance/Ports inventory page displays an overview of the performance events, data, and configuration information for each port that is being monitored by an instance of Unified Manager. This enables you to quickly monitor the performance of your ports, and to troubleshoot performance issues and threshold events.

[NOTE]
====
Performance counter values are displayed for physical ports only. Counter values are not displayed for VLANs or interface groups.
====

Depending on how you navigate to this page, the top of the page may display a different title to indicate whether the list has been filtered. For example, when displaying all ports, the title is "`Ports`". When displaying a subset of ports that is returned from the Threshold Policies page, the title is "`Ports on which policy: port_IOPS is applied`".

The buttons along the top of the page enable you to perform searches to locate specific data, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, export the data on the page to a `.csv` file, and add or remove columns from the page.

By default, objects on the object inventory pages are sorted based on object performance event criticality. Objects with critical events are listed first, and objects with warning events are listed second. This provides an immediate visual indication of issues that must be addressed. The values of the performance counters are based on an average from the previous 72 or more hours of data, as indicated on the page. You can click the refresh button to update the object inventory data.

You can assign performance threshold policies to, or clear threshold policies from, any object on the object inventory pages using the *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear PerformanceThreshold Policy* buttons.

== Ports inventory page columns

The Performance/Ports inventory page contains the following columns for each port:

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Port*
+
You can click the port name to navigate to that port's performance details page.

* *Type*
+
The port type is either Network or Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP).

* *MBps*
+
The throughput on the port, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Utilization*
+
The percentage of the port's available bandwidth that is currently being used.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the port belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Node*
+
The node to which the port belongs. You can click the node name to navigate to that node's details page.

* *Speed*
+
The maximum data transfer rate for the port.

* *Role*
+
The network port function: either Data or Cluster. FCP ports cannot have a role, and the role is displayed as N/A.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
