You can edit user settings--such as the email address and role--that are specified each user. For example, you might want to change the role of a user who is a storage operator, and assign storage administrator privileges to the user.

== Before you begin

You must have the OnCommand Administrator role.

== About this task

When you modify the role that is assigned to a user, the changes are applied when either of the following actions occur:

* The user logs out and logs back in to Unified Manager.
* Session timeout of 24 hours is reached.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Users* in the left Management menu.
. In the *Management/Users* page, select the user for which you want to edit settings, and click *Edit*.
. In the *Edit User* dialog box, edit the appropriate settings that are specified for the user.
. Click *Save*.
