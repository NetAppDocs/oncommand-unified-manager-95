Unified Manager includes a service that monitors resource issues on the host system on which Unified Manager is installed. Issues such as lack of available disk space or lack of memory on the host system may trigger management station events that are displayed as banner messages across the top of the UI.

== About this task

Management station events indicate an issue with the host system on which Unified Manager is installed. Examples of management station issues include disk space running low on the host system; Unified Manager missing a regular data collection cycle; and noncompletion, or late completion, of statistics analysis because the next collection poll was initiated.

Unlike all other Unified Manager event messages, these particular management station warning and critical events are displayed in banner messages.
