[.lead]
If you have remote authentication enabled, you can disable nested group authentication so that only individual users, and not group members, can remotely authenticate to Unified Manager. You can disable nested groups when you want to improve Active Directory authentication response time.

== Before you begin

* You must have the OnCommand Administrator role.
* Disabling nested groups is only applicable when using Active Directory.

== About this task

Disabling support for nested groups in Unified Manager might reduce the authentication time. If nested group support is disabled, and if a remote group is added to Unified Manager, individual users must be members of the remote group to authenticate to Unified Manager.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage-settings-icon.gif[]*, and then click *Authentication* in the left Setup menu.
. In the *Setup/Authentication* page, check the *Disable Nested Group Lookup* box.
. Click *Save*.
