You can configure Unified Manager to send alert notifications when an event is generated or when an event is assigned to a user. You can configure the SMTP server that is used to send the alert, and you can set various notification mechanisms--for example, alert notifications can be sent as emails or SNMP traps.

== Before you begin

You must have the following information:

* Email address from which the alert notification is sent
+
The email address appears in the "`From`" field in sent alert notifications. If the email cannot be delivered for any reason, this email address is also used as the recipient for undeliverable mail.

* SMTP server host name, and the user name and password to access the server
* SNMP version, trap destination host IP address, outbound trap port, and the community to configure the SNMP trap

You must have the OnCommand Administrator or Storage Administrator role.

== Steps

. In the toolbar, click *image:../media/clusterpage_settings_icon.gif[]*, and then click *Notifications* in the left Setup menu.
. In the *Setup/Notifications* page, configure the appropriate settings and click *Save*.
+
*Notes:*

 ** If the From Address is pre-filled with the address "`OnCommand@localhost.com`", you should change it to a real, working email address to make sure that all email notifications are delivered successfully.
 ** If the host name of the SMTP server cannot be resolved, you can specify the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the SMTP server instead of the host name.
